Please find the question below - 

There is a All-in-One Store that sells everything from groceries, medicines, clothes, books, music CDs, imported commodities etc. Standard tax rates apply on these commodities as below.  

5% on medicines and Food

5% on clothes below 1000INR and 12% above 1000INR purchase

3% on music cds/dvds

Flat 18% on the imported commodities.

Books are exempted from tax.

On every purchase I get a reciept that has the below information :

Date and Time of purchase

List of commodities, each with their final price, tax amount with the applicable rate

Total amount payable

Additionally a 5% discount is applied by the store if the bill amount exceeds 2000INR. The bill is sorted in the ascending order of the commodity names.

Write an API that computes the taxes and the final bill amount. The expected output is a JSON with all the details mentioned above.
